**About this repository**

The WSAA-Coursework repository has all my work related with the module Web Service and Applications for Data Analytics. This module has been delivered by Professor [Andrew Beatty](https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/WSAA-Courseware). 

This directory/folder contains the work related to the module's assignments. Here you can find information about the assignments of the module. 

First assignment [Card_draw](https://github.com/Jennyicano/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/assignment2-carddraw.py): 

- Using the API [Deck of Cards](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) write a program that "deals" (print out) 5 cards. 
- This program will shuffle the cards, getting the deck ID, and it'll print the value and the suit of each card. 
- Additionally the program will congratulate the user, if this one has drawn a pair, a triple, a straight, or all of the same suit. In case the user didn't get a cool hand the program will said to try again. The program will also let the user know what their highest card is. 

- To get more information about the poker hand cards I checked the [888.poker web](https://www.888poker.com/how-to-play-poker/hands/straight-poker-hand-ranking/)
- Checking some errors with the function count() that I encounter [simplilearn](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/python-tutorial/count-in-python)

Second assignment [cso](https://github.com/Jennyicano/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/assignment03-cso.py): 

- Write a program that retrieves the dataset for the "exchequer account (historical series)" from the CSO, and stores it into a file called "cso.json".
- The dataset is in the [CSO.ie](https://data.cso.ie)
