**About this repository**

The WSAA-Coursework repository has all my work related with the module Web Service and Applications for Data Analytics. This module has been delivered by Professor [Andrew Beatty](https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/WSAA-Courseware). 

This directory/folder contains the work related to the module's assignments. Here you can find information about the assignments of the module. 

*Second assignment* [Card_draw](https://github.com/Jennyicano/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/assignment2-carddraw.py): 

- Using the API [Deck of Cards](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) I wrote a program that "deals" (print out) 5 cards. 
- This program will shuffle the cards, getting the deck ID, and it'll print the value and the suit of each card. 
- Additionally the program will congratulate the user, if this one has drawn a pair, a triple, a straight, or all of the same suit. In case the user didn't get a cool hand the program will said to try again. The program will also let the user know what their highest card is. 

*Third assignment* [cso](https://github.com/Jennyicano/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/assignment03-cso.py): 

- I wrote a program that retrieves the dataset for the "exchequer account (historical series)" from the CSO, and stores it into a file called "cso.json", this file is saved in the folder data.
- The dataset is from the [CSO.ie](https://data.cso.ie).

*Fourth assignment* [github repository](https://github.com/Jennyicano/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/assignment04-github.py)

- For this assignment I wrote a program in python that read a file from a repository, this repository is private one in my GitHub profile. 
- This program replaced all the instances of the text "Andrew" with my name. And then commits those changes and push the file back to the repository. 
- The program at the end saves the file in this repository called test.txt in the folder data.

**Author**

Hey there! I’m Jenny — a part-time student studying Data Analytics at ATU Galway and working as an Annotation Analyst at Apple. I’m super into AI, machine learning, and all things data. This space is where I share the projects I'm working on, learn by doing, and (hopefully) build some cool stuff along the way.
