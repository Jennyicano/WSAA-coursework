**About this repository**

The WSAA-Coursework repository has all my work related with the module Web Service and Applications for Data Analytics. This module has been delivered by Professor [Andrew Beatty](https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/WSAA-Courseware). 

This directory/folder contains the work related to the module's assignments. Here you can find information about the assignments of the module. 

First assignment [Card_draw](https://github.com/Jennyicano/WSAA-coursework/blob/main/assignments/assignment2-carddraw.py): 

- Using the API [Deck of Cards](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) write a program that "deals" (print out) 5 cards. 
- This program will shuffle the cards, getting the deck ID, and it'll print the value and the suit of each card. 
- Additionally the program will congratulate the user, if this one has drawn a pair, a triple, a straight, or all of the same suit. 

- To get more information about the poker hand cards and checked the [888.poker web](https://www.888poker.com/how-to-play-poker/hands/straight-poker-hand-ranking/)
